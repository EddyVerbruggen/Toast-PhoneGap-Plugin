## 1. Description

This plugin allows you to show a native Toast (a little text popup) on iOS and Android.
It's great for showing a non intrusive native notification which is guaranteed always in the viewport of the browser.
* You can choose where to show the Toast: at the top, center or bottom of the screen.
* You can choose two durations: short (approx. 2 seconds), or long (approx. 5 seconds), after which the Toast automatically disappears.
* Compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman).
* Officially supported by [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/plugins).

Example usages:
* "There were validation errors"
* "Account created successfully"
* "The record was deleted"
* "Login successful"
* "The battery is almost dead"
* "You are now logged out"
* "Connection failure, please try again later"

## 3. Installation

### Automatically (CLI / Plugman)
Toast is compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman), compatible with [PhoneGap 3.0 CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface_add_features), here's how it works with the CLI (backup your project first!):

```
$ phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Toast-PhoneGap-Plugin.git
```
or
```
$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Toast-PhoneGap-Plugin.git
$ cordova prepare
```

Toast.js is brought in automatically. There is no need to change or add anything in your html.

### Manually

1\. Add the following xml to your `config.xml` in the root directory of your `www` folder:
```xml
<!-- for iOS -->
<feature name="Toast">
  <param name="ios-package" value="Toast" />
</feature>
```
```xml
<!-- for Android -->
<feature name="Toast">
  <param name="android-package" value="nl.xservices.plugins.Toast" />
</feature>
```

For iOS, you'll need to add the `QuartzCore.framework` to your project (it's for automatically removing the Toast after a few seconds).
Click your project, Build Phases, Link Binary With Libraries, search for and add `QuartzCore.framework`.

2\. Grab a copy of Toast.js, add it to your project and reference it in `index.html`:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/Toast.js"></script>
```

3\. Download the source files for iOS and/or Android and copy them to your project.

iOS: Copy the two `.h` and two `.m` files to `platforms/ios/<ProjectName>/Plugins`

Android: Copy `Toast.java` to `platforms/android/src/nl/xservices/plugins` (create the folders)

### PhoneGap Build

Toast works with PhoneGap build too, but only with PhoneGap 3.0 and up.

Just add the following xml to your `config.xml` to always use the latest version of this plugin:
```xml
<gap:plugin name="nl.x-services.plugins.toast" />
```
or to use this exact version:
```xml
<gap:plugin name="nl.x-services.plugins.toast" version="1.0" />
```

Toast.js is brought in automatically. There is no need to change or add anything in your html.

## 4. Usage
You have two choices to make when showing a Toast: where to show it and for how long.
* show(message, duration, position)
 * duration: 'short', 'long', 'tillclick' 
 * position: 'top', 'center', 'bottom'

NOTE: tillclick only available on iOS !

You can also use any of these convenience methods:
* showShortTop(message)
* showShortCenter(message)
* showShortBottom(message)
* showLongTop(message)
* showLongCenter(message)
* showLongBottom(message)

You can copy-paste these lines of code for a quick test:
```html
<button onclick="window.plugins.toast.showShortTop('Hello there!', function(a){console.log('toast success: ' + a)}, function(b){alert('toast error: ' + b)})">Toast showShortTop</button>
<button onclick="window.plugins.toast.showLongBottom('Hello there!', function(a){console.log('toast success: ' + a)}, function(b){alert('toast error: ' + b)})">Toast showLongBottom</button>
<button onclick="window.plugins.toast.show('Hello there!', 'long', 'center', function(a){console.log('toast success: ' + a)}, function(b){alert('toast error: ' + b)})">Toast show long center</button>
```
